## Features
- Both slow and fast crouch walking are implemented.
    - NPCs are only alerted while fast crouch walking in close proximity.
- Crouching affects your visibility to enemies (i.e, you can hide behind cover)
- The camo index is dynamically adjusted while crouch walking.
- Seamlessly integrated into the game engine as a genuine feature, without displacing any existing functionality.
  
## Credits
- Zoft for mtar research and porting the 3DS animations over to the Master Collection
